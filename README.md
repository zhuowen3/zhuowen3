### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Zhuowen Li

I'm a Computer Science graduate with experience in data visualization and full-stack development.  
I worked on a project visualizing GPS DOP data in collaboration with aerospace experts.  
Currently building my own e-commerce website and starting a business with friends.  
The project is in development â€” setting up legal groundwork, brainstorming names/domains, and sourcing suppliers.  
It's an exciting side venture alongside my passion for coding.
